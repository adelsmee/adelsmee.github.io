title : The Time We Looked For Work as a Software Development Team
excerpt: After being laid off as a team we thought we'd try looking for work together. Here's how we did it, what happened and if anyone would do it again.

#### The Backstory

Part of this story is a common one. Established company in an industry undergoing major disruption hires developers to innovate back to viability. Management lacks clear vision of what that means and so chops and changes (*not* pivots, that's something else) technology strategy several times. After two years of hard work there is nothing to show for it, so the developers are blamed for not building the right thing and let go. 

But that's only part of the story, the corporate one. The human part of the story is a bit more interesting. The team was composed of eight full stack developers, primarily working in Ruby on Rails and CoffeeScript with AWS serving it all up. The team was lively, intelligent, incredibly collaborative and built scalable, well tested software. We were good at solving problems together, appreciated each others company and enjoyed coming to work. We had spent nearly a year prior to the redundancy building a hypermedia API that never saw the light of day. We were professionally demoralised but still appreciated the chemistry (and targeted hiring process) that had produced such a capable and functional development team. So we decided as an experiment to see what would happen if we made some calls and tried to find work as a team. 

The expectations of the team were pretty low. One of the devs summed up our chances of success as "improbable" and we all agreed that was a fair assessment, but figured it wouldn't hurt to ask considering how great it would be if we could keep the good stuff.

#### The Process

To attempt to make the process as efficient as possible I started by contacting a bunch of folks to see if anyone was interested. As a team of eight with a strong network in the Melbourne tech community we were able to access about a dozen phone numbers and email addresses of development managers in companies with solid reputations. We were pleasantly surprised at the universally positive responses. During the initial conversation most managers were hesitant, however after thinking about the benefits of getting a full stack team who worked well together with a strong focus on process and quality all of them saw the potential benefits pretty quickly. I would also imagine that since the cost of recruitment is so high managers are happy with the direct approach as it saves them a packet.

I followed the first contact with an in-person or Hangout conversation with each of the managers to discuss the breakdown of the team, individual skills and to answer any questions they had. We also discussed the realistic possiblity of their company being able to offer the entire team a position, as our goal was to try to stay together this was initially one of the key criteria. Only one of the companies was unable to consider offering the entire team positions and that was more a matter of timing than anything else.

Once we'd established the possibility of a team hiring we needed to make a decision as a team to narrow down the field. From the initial dozen we selected six companies that best represented the kind of technology, culture and product that we wanted to work with. As a team we then met with each of the companies and they took us all through the kinds of projects, tools and processes we could expect working for them. Each of the meetings were different depending on the culture of the company - some over lunch, some in boardrooms with presentations and some at the pub. They were a real boost for us as we all got to make some new connections, but they also demonstrated to the team just how valuable these companies thought they were. Going through the job application process is always nerve-wracking, but it helps a lot when the company I am applying to has just laid on free sandwiches and/or beer in an effort to entice me to do so. 

From there we had another team-deciderer session (these took place at the local pub but did include large sheets of paper and coloured pens) to narrow down the field yet again. Going through a job application process as a software developer is quite a bit of hard work and we thought doing it for two companies would be enough and hopefully give us the options we needed. Mention about all the companies being great options. Mention the rejection phone calls being tough. Mention that all the options were good ones and we were spoiled for choice.

#### The Good

##### Expectations

It was a great benefit to the whole process that we didn't have any concrete expectations around what would happen and how. There were so many variables in applying and being offered a job, many of which were totally outside our control, that if we'd had an idea of what it would be like we definitely would have been disappointed.

#### The Bad


#### The Outcome

Of the team of eight all were offered roles at at least one of the two companies. Four engineers chose one company as being the best fit for them. Three engineers chose the other company as being the best fit for them. One engineer decided to decline the offer and stay on at the original company for a couple more months.

#### Would We Do It Again?

Of the eight engineers seven would do it again and one would not.
Of the two companies that we applied to x would do it again.
