          <div class="post_content">
            <p><p>I thought about starting with a quote from the Dalai Lama about being <a href="http://wineandbowties.com/ideas/his-holiness-the-dalai-lama-on-selfishness/">wisely selfish</a> but then I thought, no, that&#39;s immediately going to alienate a bunch of people who really might need to read this. So instead I&#39;ll ask a couple of questions - how are your software development efforts going? Getting projects completed on time and near budget? Customers satisfied? Money rolling in? Developers sticking around? If the answers include no then I&#39;d ask you to take the time to read this and consider if maybe the problem isn&#39;t with the industry/sales team/techies/exchange rate/economy but instead with how happy your developers are. Here&#39;s why it&#39;s an idea worth pondering:</p>

          <div class="post_content">
            <p><p>At home I have a chocolate tin. It accommodates my obsession for buying every chocolate bar I see that I have yet to taste. I have reasonably strong preferences and usually go for dark chocolate but will buy milk or white, assuming it has been made with cocoa butter and not some random vegetable fat. I don&#39;t actually eat that much chocolate, maybe a square or two a day, unless we are talking about Whittaker&#39;s Dark Almond in which case I&#39;ll go a whole row of that. However eating is the least fun thing about chocolate for me. I love telling stories about all the different chocolates and vicariously sharing the pleasure other people get from it.</p>
