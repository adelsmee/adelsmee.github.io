    <h1>The Time We Looked For Work as a Software Development Team</h1>
  </div>
  <h3>The Backstory</h3>

<p>Part of this story is a common one. Established company in an industry undergoing major disruption hires developers to innovate back to viability. Management lacks clear vision of what that means and so chops and changes (<em>not</em> pivots, that&#39;s something else) technology strategy several times. After two years of hard work there is nothing to show for it, so the developers are blamed for not building the right thing and let go. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s only part of the story, the corporate one. The human part of the story is a bit more interesting. The team was composed of eight full stack developers, primarily working in Ruby on Rails and CoffeeScript with AWS serving it all up. The team was lively, intelligent, incredibly collaborative and built scalable, well tested software. We were good at solving problems together, appreciated each others company and enjoyed coming to work. We had spent nearly a year prior to the redundancy building a hypermedia API that never saw the light of day. We were professionally demoralised but still appreciated the chemistry (and targeted hiring process) that had produced such a capable and functional development team. So we decided as an experiment to see what would happen if we made some calls and tried to find work as a team. </p>

<p>The expectations of the team were pretty low. One of the devs summed up our chances of success as &quot;improbable&quot; and we all agreed that was a fair assessment, but figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to ask considering how great it would be if we could keep all the good stuff (the team) from our former employers.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>

<h3>The Good</h3>

<h5>Expectations</h5>

<p>It was a great benefit to the whole process that we didn&#39;t have any concrete expectations around what would happen and how. There were so many variables in applying and being offered a job, many of which were totally outside our control, that if we&#39;d had an idea of what it would be like we definitely would have been disappointed.</p>

<h3>The Bad</h3>

<h3>The Outcome</h3>

<p>Of the team of eight all were offered roles at at least one of the two companies. Four engineers chose one company as being the best fit for them. Three engineers chose the other company as being the best fit for them. One engineer decided to decline the offer and stay on at the original company for a couple more months.</p>

<h3>Would We Do It Again?</h3>
